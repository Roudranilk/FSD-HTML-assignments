    <h1>Convolution Neural Networks</h1>
    <p>A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of Deep Learning architecture commonly used for image classification and recognition tasks. It consists of multiple layers, including Convolutional layers, Pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The Convolutional layer applies filters to the input image to extract features, the Pooling layer downsamples the image to reduce computation, and the fully connected layer makes the final prediction. The network learns the optimal filters through backpropagation and gradient descent.</p>
