    <h1>Convolution Neural Networks</h1>
    <p>A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm that can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image, and be able to differentiate one from the other. The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms. While in primitive methods filters are hand-engineered, with enough training, ConvNets have the ability to learn these filters/characteristics.</p>
    <h2>Convolution Layer</h2>
    <p>In the above demonstration, the green section resembles our 5x5x1 input image, I. The element involved in the convolution operation in the first part of a Convolutional Layer is called the Kernel/Filter, K, represented in color yellow. We have selected K as a 3x3x1 matrix.</p>
    <h2>Pooling Layer</h2>
    <P>Similar to the Convolutional Layer, the Pooling layer is responsible for reducing the spatial size of the Convolved Feature. This is to decrease the computational power required to process the data through dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, it is useful for extracting dominant features which are rotational and positional invariant, thus maintaining the process of effectively training the model.</P>
