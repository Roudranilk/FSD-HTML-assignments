    <h1>What is a Artificial Neural Networks?</h1>
    <p>The term "Artificial neural network" refers to a biologically inspired sub-field of artificial intelligence modeled after the brain. An Artificial neural network is usually a computational network based on biological neural networks that construct the structure of the human brain. Similar to a human brain has neurons interconnected to each other, artificial neural networks also have neurons that are linked to each other in various layers of the networks. These neurons are known as nodes.
    
        <h3>What is the architecture of ann?</h3>
    <p>To understand the concept of the architecture of an artificial neural network, we have to understand what a neural network consists of. In order to define a neural network that consists of a large number of artificial neurons, which are termed units arranged in a sequence of layers. Lets us look at various types of layers available in an artificial neural network.</p>
    
    <h3>How do artificial neural networks work?</h3>
    <p>Artificial Neural Network can be best represented as a weighted directed graph, where the artificial neurons form the nodes. The association between the neurons outputs and neuron inputs can be viewed as the directed edges with weights. The Artificial Neural Network receives the input signal from the external source in the form of a pattern and image in the form of a vector. These inputs are then mathematically assigned by the notations x(n) for every n number of inputs.</p>
    
    <h2>Advantages of Artificial Neural Networks:</h2>
    <ul>
            <li>Parallel processing capability</li>
            <li>Storing data on the entire network</li>
           <li>Capability to work with incomplete knowledge</li>
            <li>Having fault tolerance</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Disadvantages of Artificial Neural Networks:</h2>
 <ol>
        <li>Assurance of proper network structure</li>
            <li>Unrecognized behavior of the network</li>
           <li>Hardware dependence</li>
            <li>Difficulty of showing the issue to the network</li>
</ol>
